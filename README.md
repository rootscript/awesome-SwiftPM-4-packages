# awesome-SwiftPM-4-packages
A list of packages that work with SwiftPM 4 (Apple Swift Package Manager 4)

Where can I find Swift packages?
One issue the Swift Package Manager is that unlike similar tools, there’s no built-in functionality to search for packages.
* <https://packagecatalog.com/> IBM’s Swift Package Catalog — IBM has announced the deprecation of the Swift Package Catalog, to take place in January of 2018.
* <https://swiftmodules.com>
* <http://swiftpack.co/>
* <https://swift.org/source-compatibility/#current-list-of-projects>

Note: I don't find the above list particularly useful as they don't state which version of SPM they target (which is why I'm maling this SPM4 list).
